YAQITH Sentinel – Behavioral AI Security Agent


YAQITH Sentinel is an AI-powered security agent designed to enhance digital identity protection inside the Absher platform by combining official digital identity with behavioral biometrics.



The system analyzes multiple real-time signals—such as device identity, IP address, location, typing patterns, navigation timing, and login history—to verify whether the user is the legitimate account owner.


What Problem Does It Solve?


Traditional authentication (password, OTP, biometrics) can still be bypassed through identity theft or device spoofing.

YAQITH adds a second behavioral layer that is extremely difficult to fake, providing continuous and intelligent authentication.


How It Works


The agent performs three core functions:



1. Data Collection
Device type & browser

IP address & location

Login timestamps

Behavioral signals (typing speed, navigation rhythm, touch patterns)



2. Anomaly Detection


A lightweight ML model analyzes the user’s normal behavior and detects unusual activity.



3. Risk Scoring & Action


Based on the risk score:

Low risk: seamless login

Medium risk: request additional verification

High risk: block or escalate the session


Key Features
Real-time behavioral authentication

Detects suspicious logins with high accuracy

Privacy-preserving (anonymized behavior patterns)

Adds security without affecting user experience
